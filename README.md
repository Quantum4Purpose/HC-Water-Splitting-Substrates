# 🧠 Hackathon Challenge  
## Screening Water Splitting Substrates with Quantum Simulations

---

### 🎯 Challenge Objective  
Participants are invited to explore how quantum computing can accelerate the discovery of efficient and affordable catalysts for water splitting — a critical reaction for sustainable hydrogen production. The aim is to simulate various substrate materials using quantum algorithms and compare their hydrogen yield potential.

---

### 🔍 Problem Statement  
Water splitting is a key technology in the transition to green energy, enabling the production of hydrogen without greenhouse gas emissions. Current industrial methods rely heavily on platinum catalysts, which are costly and scarce. Promising alternatives, such as doped graphene, could provide similar performance at lower costs — but testing these combinations in the lab is time-consuming. Quantum computing offers a novel route to simulate and evaluate these materials more efficiently.

### 🛠 Context and Background  
The challenge addresses a critical question in materials science and quantum chemistry: how can we simulate quantum systems, such as catalytic reactions, more effectively?  
Classical simulations are limited by computational costs, especially for complex quantum interactions. Leveraging platforms such as IBM Qiskit and variational quantum algorithms (e.g., VQE), participants will simulate candidate materials to identify optimal configurations for water splitting.  
This challenge is proposed by the **Computational Nanoelectronics** research group at **ETH Zurich**, a leading institution in nanoelectronics and quantum simulation research.
